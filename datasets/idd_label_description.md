A image of road from IDD dataset: The part of the ground where motorized vehicles, such as cars and trucks, usually drive. It includes all lanes in all directions and is marked for vehicle travel. Excludes any objects on the road like curbs, or parking spaces that are texture-differentiated from the main road.
A image of drivable fallback or parking from IDD dataset: Areas that can be driven on but are not part of the main road, including parking spaces or temporarily drivable surfaces. Excludes roads meant for regular traffic flow and sidewalks. Includes unmarked or auxiliary areas that might allow temporary vehicle access.
A image of sidewalk from IDD dataset: A section of the ground designated for pedestrian use, separated from the road by a curb or other barrier. It is often elevated and found along the sides of roads. This category includes walkable areas like traffic islands or pedestrian zones, excluding roads or drivable areas.
A image of non-drivable fallback or rail track from IDD dataset: Any part of the ground that cannot be driven on, such as grassy patches, rail tracks, or other surfaces clearly not intended for vehicle use. This includes areas adjacent to or crossing the road but not accessible to regular vehicle traffic.
A image of person or animal from IDD dataset: Living beings visible in the image, including both humans and animals. This label is used for any individual in the scene, whether walking, riding a vehicle, or standing on the ground.
A image of out of roi or rider from IDD dataset: Regions outside the region of interest (ROI) or individuals riding a vehicle, such as a motorcycle rider. This category covers both irrelevant image areas and riders who are passengers on bicycles or motorcycles.
A image of motorcycle from IDD dataset: A two-wheeled motorized vehicle designed for the transport of one or more riders. Includes scooters and motorbikes but excludes the riders themselves (who are labeled separately under "rider").
A image of bicycle from IDD dataset: A two-wheeled vehicle powered by pedaling, intended for use by cyclists. Does not include the cyclist, who would be labeled separately as "person" or "rider."
A image of autorickshaw from IDD dataset: A small, motorized three-wheeled vehicle often used for short-distance public transportation. It is distinct from cars and other vehicles due to its unique structure and purpose.
A image of car from IDD dataset: A four-wheeled motor vehicle designed primarily for passenger transport on roads. Includes sedans, hatchbacks, and other personal vehicles but excludes larger vehicles like trucks and buses.
A image of truck from IDD dataset: A motor vehicle larger than a car, designed primarily for transporting goods. Includes delivery trucks, pickup trucks, and other cargo-bearing vehicles.
A image of bus from IDD dataset: A large motorized vehicle used for public or group transportation, capable of carrying multiple passengers. Distinct from cars and trucks due to its size and purpose.
A image of trailer or caravan or vehicle fallback from IDD dataset: Any non-motorized vehicle attached to a larger motorized vehicle, such as a trailer or caravan. This label also includes fallback categories for other undetermined vehicles.
A image of curb from IDD dataset: A raised edge separating the road from the sidewalk or other pedestrian zones. It often forms the boundary between the drivable road and non-drivable areas.
A image of wall from IDD dataset: A vertical, solid structure made from materials like brick, concrete, or stone. Typically part of a building or used as a barrier in outdoor spaces.
A image of fence from IDD dataset: A vertical structure made from materials like wood, metal, or wire that forms a boundary or barrier, often surrounding properties or fields.
A image of guard rail from IDD dataset: A safety barrier, usually made of metal, placed along roads to prevent vehicles from veering off the roadway, especially at curves or near drop-offs.
A image of billboard from IDD dataset: A large outdoor sign or advertisement structure, typically placed on poles or buildings near roadways, intended for visibility from a distance.
A image of traffic sign from IDD dataset: Signs placed near or on the road that provide information or instructions to drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. This category includes stop signs, speed limits, and directional signs.
A image of traffic light from IDD dataset: A signal with colored lights (usually red, yellow, and green) used to control vehicle and pedestrian movement at intersections.
A image of polegroup or pole from IDD dataset: Vertical structures such as streetlights, utility poles, or signage poles. This label applies to both individual poles and grouped poles in close proximity.
A image of obs-str-bar-fallback from IDD dataset: Obstacles or structural barriers that do not fall into more specific categories like fences or walls. This fallback label is used for ambiguous barriers.
A image of building from IDD dataset: Any man-made structure intended for habitation or commercial use, such as houses, offices, and shops.
A image of tunnel or bridge from IDD dataset: Infrastructure that allows for the passage of vehicles or pedestrians, either over (bridge) or through (tunnel) an obstacle, like a river or a hill.
A image of vegetation from IDD dataset: Natural plant life in the scene, including grass, trees, shrubs, and other flora.
A image of sky or fallback background from IDD dataset: The visible sky in the scene or other fallback background elements that do not fit into the categories of objects or structures within the region of interest.
